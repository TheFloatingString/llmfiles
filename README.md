# llmfiles

A collection of config files for Claude Code and related coding agents. 

## Roadmap

- Create a `.md` file for every programming language (or task) of interest
- Benchmarks for code style and performance (i.e. pass@1 success rate)
- Parser that pulls config files for specific languages without overwriting or duplicating instructions
