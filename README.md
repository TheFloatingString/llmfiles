# llmfiles

A collection of config files for Claude Code and related coding agents. 

## Quickstart

```bash
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheFloatingString/llmfiles/refs/heads/main/PYTHON.md -o CLAUDE.md
```

## Roadmap

- Create a `.md` file for every programming language (or task) of interest
- Benchmarks for code style and performance (i.e. pass@1 success rate)
- Parser that pulls config files for specific languages without overwriting or duplicating instructions
